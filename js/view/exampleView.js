 * - populating the view with the data
 * - updating the view when the data changes
 * 
 * You should create a view class like this for every view in your UI.
 * 
 * @param {Object} container - references the HTML parent element that contains the view.
 * @param {Object} model - the reference to the Dinner Model

		 * 
		 * IMPORTANT: Never use document.querySelector() directly in the views. Always use
		 * some other way of searching only among the containers child elements. In this way you
